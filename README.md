# HIT339-Assignment-3
Website for HIT339 ("Distributed Development"), Charles Darwin University. This was the final assignment, where our group was required to create site for a tennis organisation that provides information on their scheduled events and coaches using ASP.NET. Our site uses data from an existing read-only remote database in conjunction with a local database.
